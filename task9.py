'''Razo - **First** Create a program to choose a 
random password, the password should consist 
of 4 digits, 1 letter and 1 character 
(? $%# and so on), We need to have a 
letter in the password first, then 
numbers and run out on the symbol.  '''
# import random
# Letter = random.choice("abcdefjyoplin")
# Character = random.choice("?$%#")
# Number1 = random.randint(0,9)
# Number2 = random.randint(0,9)
# Number3 = random.randint(0,9)
# Number4 = random.randint(0,9)
# print(Letter+Character+str(Number1)+str(Number2)+str(Number3)+str(Number4))

'''Razo - **Second** You need to have 2 inputs in 
which you need to specify a word/text to count and
 say which one is longer if the texts of the same 
 length indicate that the length of the first and 
 second text are the same '''


'''Mary - ou (input) and pc have pens (pc have
random pens) if your pens
is great 35 % than pc you are pupil otherwise
pc is pupil.'''

# import random
# User = int(input("User Pens: "))
# Pc = random.randint(1,100)
# print("Pc pens", Pc)
# if User / Pc <= 35 / 100:
# 	print("Pc is pupil")
# else:
# 	print("User is pupil")

'''Mary - ou have 2 inputs(m and v). Calculate the kinetic energy. 
Then determine kinetic and potencial(input) energies and 
print the biggest one.'''

# m = int(input("M: "))
# v = int(input("V: "))
# E = m * v ** 2 / 2
# print(E)
